# EEG analysis exercise

Try using the tools and approaches we have covered to code the following analyses (focus on the simplest version of the first question, and move to the other optional questions only if there is extra time).

- Find the non-trivial peaks of the waveform

- (*advanced*) Find the frequency of the oscillating part of the waveform

- (*hard*) Find the delay, also known as latency, between the M1 and S1 signals
